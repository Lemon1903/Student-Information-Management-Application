# Student-Information-Management-Application
Student Infomation Management Application is a simple application that lets the user manage and organize a collection of student information in a school for example. I made this project to test and apply my knowledge about OOP and Single Responsibility Principle under SOLID Design Principle.

Features:
- Display all student information
- Insert new student information
- Delete a studetn information
- Search a student information
- Edit a student information

## Inheritance Test Folder
This folder is only for testing the inheritance OOP concept which I used to apply in my project. It is an OOP concept where you can make a superclass which all of the methods and properties under this superclass will be inherited by the other class inheriting it. It is useful because it helps us in code reusability. 

## Student Information Management Folder
This folder includes the main program C# script and the solution of the whole application.

## Student Management Library Folder
This folder contains all of the classes I used in this program. It contains:
- Messages - the display messages and the options message.
- Student Information - includes the student data and student information.
- Student Option Methods - includes all the classes for the program functionality.
- User Input - classes for user input and validating user input.
